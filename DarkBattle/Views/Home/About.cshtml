            I have been interesetd in game mechanics , tactics and graphic design.
            When I have to choose a theme for my web project I decided to do something interesting to me - game.
            DarkBattle is RPG browser game,where you can create 3 champions and level up them, collect gear and fight with powerfull mosters.
            The project is based on C# and my purpose have been to create a good backend server logic , not so much front end.
